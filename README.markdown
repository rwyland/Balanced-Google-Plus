This project is for creating a Google Chrome Extension which re-styles specific css classes for all Google+ pages.

The goal of the extension is to resolve an error that the G+ team made: push an update which was missing a key feature and left a giant whitespace on every page.

To build the extension: 
  1. Enable Developer Mode in your Chrome browser under Wrench -> Settings -> Extensions
  2. Then load the unpacked extension by selected the directory of the project.
